# Wiz Security Demo - Intentionally Vulnerable Container
# This Dockerfile demonstrates common container security issues that tools like Wiz detect
# Built for educational purposes to show real-world vulnerabilities

FROM node:24-alpine

# ðŸš¨ INTENTIONAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES FOR DEMONSTRATION:
# 
# 1. KUBERNETES OVER-PRIVILEGES:
#    - Service account with cluster-admin privileges (configured in K8s manifests)
#    - Container can perform any action in the cluster
#
# 2. MONGODB CREDENTIALS IN ENV:
#    - Database credentials passed via environment variables
#    - Visible in container inspection and process lists
#
# 3. DETECTION:
#    - Wiz would flag over-privileged service accounts
#    - Security scanners would detect credential exposure
#    - Compliance frameworks would mark as non-compliant

# ðŸ“‹ REQUIREMENT VALIDATION: wizexercise.txt file
# The Wiz exercise requires a file named "wizexercise.txt" containing the candidate's name
# This build-time validation ensures the requirement is met before container deployment
